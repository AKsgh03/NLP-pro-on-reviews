This project analyzes customer reviews of Amazon Alexa products to predict user feedback (positive or negative) based on review text. The dataset contains features like review rating, product variation, and verified customer reviews. The primary goal is to build a machine learning model that can classify feedback using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

Key steps include:
Text preprocessing (tokenization, stemming, removing stopwords)
- Feature extraction using Count Vectorizer
- Training and evaluating multiple models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Visualizing the sentiment distribution and model performance

The Random Forest Classifier achieved a high accuracy score, making it a robust solution for this sentiment analysis task.
